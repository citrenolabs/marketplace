**`mp`**, short for **`marketpalce`**, is a command-line interface (CLI)
tool designed to streamline the development and maintenance of Google SecOps marketplace
integrations.
It empowers developers by providing a unified platform for building,
testing, and ensuring the quality of their integrations.

## Key Features

- **Build Integrations**: Convert non-built integrations to the format required by
  Google SecOps Marketplace
- **Deconstruct Integrations**: Convert built integrations back to the source code format
- **Code Quality**: Format and lint Python code with ruff, and statically type-check
  with mypy
- **Developer Workflow**: Streamline the development process with helpful commands and
  fast dependency management using uv

## Documentation

For detailed information on how to use and contribute to `mp`, please refer to the
documentation:

- [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)—How to install the tool
- [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md)—How to use the available commands
- [Development Guide](docs/development.md)—How to set up your development environment

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get help
mp --help

# Format Python files
mp format path/to/files

# Check code quality
mp check path/to/files --static-type-check --fix --unsafe-fixes

# Build an integration
mp build --quiet --repository third_party

# Run integration tests pre build
mp test --verbose --integration my_integration

# Configure mp parameters
mp config --root-path . --processes 7 --display-config
```

## Development Environment Commands

The `dev-env` subcommands help you interact with the development playground environment.

### Authentication Methods

The `mp dev-env` commands support two authentication methods:

#### 1. Username/Password Authentication (SOAR only instance)
Use your SOAR environment username and password for authentication.

#### 2. API Key Authentication (Recommended for SecOps)
Use an API key for more secure and convenient authentication. This method is particularly useful for automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

### Getting Your SecOps Environment Credentials

#### API Root
To get your SecOps environment API root:
1. Open your SecOps environment in a web browser
2. Open the browser's Developer Console (F12)
3. Execute: `localStorage['soar_server-addr']`
4. Copy the returned URL - this is your API root

#### API Key Creation
To create an API key for authentication:
1. Log into your SecOps environment
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **SOAR Settings** → **Advanced** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create**
4. Set **Permission Groups** to `Admins`
5. Copy the generated API key

### Login to Dev Environment

#### Using API Key (Recommended)
```bash
mp dev-env login --api-root https://xx.siemplify-soar.com --api-key your-api-key
```

#### Using Username/Password
```bash
mp dev-env login --api-root https://xx.siemplify-soar.com --username your-username --password your-password
```

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
mp dev-env login
```
This will prompt you for credentials interactively.

#### Skip Credential Verification
```bash
mp dev-env login --no-verify
```

### Deploy an Integration to Dev Environment

Build and deploy an integration to the dev environment:

```bash
mp dev-env deploy <integration_name>
```

- `<integration_name>`: The name of the integration directory under `integrations/commercial` or `integrations/third_party`.
