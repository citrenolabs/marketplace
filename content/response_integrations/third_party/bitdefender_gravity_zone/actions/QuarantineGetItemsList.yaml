description: 'This method retrieves the list of quarantined items available for a
    company. An item can be a file or an Microsoft Exchange object.

    The filter fields Threat Name, File Path, and IP Address work with partial matching.

    The filter returns the items which are exact match or start with the specified
    value.

    To use the specified value as a suffix, use the asterisk symbol (*). For example:

    If filePath is C:\temp, the API returns all items originating from this folder,
    including sub-folders.

    If filePath is *myfile.exe, then the API returns a list of all myfile.exe files
    from anywhere on the system.

    The Exchange filters require a valid license key for Security for Exchange.'
