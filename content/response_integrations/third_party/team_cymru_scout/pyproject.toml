description = "Team Cymru's Pure Signal Scout integration with Google SecOps SOAR helps streamline incident triage and accelerate threat response by providing domain, IP, network communications and netflow threat intelligence data. This capability allows threat analysts to quickly identify and understand whether IPâ€™s, assets and domains are associated with threat actors, malware, botnets or other malicious campaigns. This integration was tested with the APIs of Team Cymru Scout. In case of any queries, please reach out to support@cymru.com."
